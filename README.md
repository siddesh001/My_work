<h1>What the folder contains...</h1>

 <h2>time_left.py </h2><br>My first program was to create a watch in python which shows how much time is remaining in the day. This has helped me to keep working and understand that there is limited time in a day.(not wasting time in Gibberish) 

I will keep on updating the file as i get better programs
